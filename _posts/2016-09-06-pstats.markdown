pStats is a concept shiny app to explore political data from Spain.


It's inspired by [u/DataVisualisations](https://www.reddit.com/user/DataVisualisations) in the [Data is Beautiful subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/). (particularly this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4sr0vl/the_fall_of_new_labour_and_rise_of_the/?))

You can check out the full shiny app [here](https://davidmasp.shinyapps.io/pstats) or at:

## Background

Although Spain has a young democracy compared with UK, an considerable amount of elections have already been held. Moreover, Spain have a very dynamic party system and different dynamics and patterns can be extracted than the ones in UK/US politics.

We live in a Parlamaint system (as UK) but the election is held not by uninominal circumscriptions but with large amount of representatives chosen by large number of people (provincias). Since the first elections at 1977 a two-party system has been stablished really quick based on [Partido Popular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Party_(Spain)) (People's Party) and [Partido Socialista](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partido_Socialista_Obrero_Espa√±ol) (Socialist Party).

However, in 2011 a popular movement arise to the streets and called themselves "indignados" (the outraged). This civil movement stablished basically in large cities like Madrid and Barcelona have inspired a group of politcs professors at Universidad Complutense de Madrid to form a leftish political party with the aim to absorb the movement. This party [PODEMOS](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podemos) was founded in 2014 and has held already 4 types of elections (Townships, EU elections, regionals and nationals).

A party named [Ciudadanos](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudadanos-Partido_de_la_Ciudadan%C3%ADa) has also grown really quickly from a youth and small catalan party in 2009 to a nationwide and decisive party.

This change in the paradigma have risen a interesting topic about representatives in our electoral system. Normally, parties with really low votes had really low representation per vote but have been considered normal or not really changing. Examples of this behavior are Izquierda Unida (the communist party) or Union Progreso y Democracia (UPyD) as seen in the image below.

The new parties mentioned before are clearly more popular in industrial and metropolitan areas because the cosmopolite environment and the will to change. Therefore, as they gain popularity they are claiming for a change in the electoral system as they believe they are unrepresented.

In this small concept project I wanted to examine if this is really a problem in Spain's system and compare it with other systems around the world. You can check an the post for the Australian parliament [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/4sr0vl/the_fall_of_new_labour_and_rise_of_the/?).  

## Analysis

With this post I don't try to analyse any data and just leaving the tool for whoever would need it. However, some interesting thoughts come to my mind.

### The breach is not that high

Specially compared with uninominal systems like UK, the image below shows clearly how the difference in representation (like a diagonal axis) is not very high between the traditional parties like PP and PSOE an Cs and PODEMOS. It's clear that the most affected party is Cs so it's normal they are the most active supporters for the law change.

### Podemos in countryside

Although Podemos is a clearly city party we have seen that with the alliance in 2016 with the comunist party (IU) they have increased its representative ratio to almost the equal line. This behavior has let them increase the number of seats without increasing the number of votes. We have to congratulate them for a good strategy movement.
